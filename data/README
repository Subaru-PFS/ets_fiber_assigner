*** PFS FoV Information ver. 1 (Apr. 2016) ***

Description
-----------
 This contains a set of files for information on the current configuration of the PFS FoV. The information on the position center and patrol area of 2394 cobras, the position center and covering area of 2394 dots, and the position and dimension of six A&G camera are described in "fiberpos.elxx.dat", "dotpos.elxx.dat", and "agcpos.elxx.dat", respectively. Since the distortion depends on the telescope elevation (EL), we prepare three cases of different ELs (xx=30, 60, and 90 deg.). Some details on the calculation and assumptions are also described in "Notes_FiberIdentifications_v1.pdf". The slide written by Atsushi Shimono (Kavli IPMU) would be useful for the hardware limitation to the target mapping. Note that the dot positions and the how to deal with the uncertainty of the dot coverage area due to the limitation of the rotator angle in the actual operation are still under discussion. Brief description of each file is as follows:

1. fiberpos.elxx.dat: the position center and the radius of the patrol area of cobras

 Column 1 : Fiber ID
 Column 2 : X position on PFI [mm]
 Column 3 : Y position on PFI [mm]
 Column 4 : Radius of the patrol area on PFI [mm]
 Column 5 : Minimum separation to the next fiber [mm]
 Column 6 : X position on sky [arcsec]
 Column 7 : Y position on sky [arcsec]
 Column 8 : Radius of the patrol area on sky [arcsec]
 Column 9 : Minimum separation ot the next fiber [arcsec]

Note: The zero point of the coordinate is set to be the center of the FoV, which is the telescope pointing center and also the instrument rotator center. If you require the position of the fixed fiducial fibers too, please let us know.

2. dotpos.elxx.dat: the position center and the radius of the covering area of dots
 
 Column 1 : Fiber ID
 Column 2 : X position on PFI [mm]
 Column 3 : Y position on PFI [mm]
 Column 4 : Radius of the area that dots cover on PFI [mm]
 Column 5 : X position on sky [arcsec]
 Column 6 : Y position on sky [arcsec]
 Column 7 : Radius of the area that dots cover on sky [arcsec]

Note: In the normal operation, movement of the instrument rotator during the observation is restricted to +/-60 deg. For this reason, if necessary, one will rotate the fiber configuration on the FoV by a multiple of 60 deg. before starting observation, because the configuration of cobras has a rotational symmetry of 60 deg. The center of dot is, however, slightly shifted from the center of the cobra center by 1.19 [mm], which means that the array of dots does not have rotational symmetry of 60 deg. So the covering area by dots should be different from the original relative position of the dots if the fiber configuration is rotated. There are six possible different relationships between cobra and dots (see "plot_pfs_fov.pdf"). This effect should be considered properly in the ETS algorithm. As mentioned above, however, the dot positions and the how to deal with the uncertainty of the dot coverage area due to the limit of the rotator angle in the actual operation are still under discussion.

3. agcpos.elxx.dat: the position of A&G cameras (AGCs)

 Column 1  : AGC ID
 Column 2  : X position of AGC point a on PFI [mm]
 Column 3  : Y position of AGC point a on PFI [mm]
 Column 4  : X position of AGC point a on sky [arcsec]
 Column 5  : Y position of AGC point a on sky [arcsec]
 Column 6  : X position of AGC point b on PFI [mm]
 Column 7  : Y position of AGC point b on PFI [mm]
 Column 8  : X position of AGC point b on sky [arcsec]
 Column 9  : Y position of AGC point b on sky [arcsec]
 Column 10 : X position of AGC point c on PFI [mm]
 Column 11 : Y position of AGC point c on PFI [mm]
 Column 12 : X position of AGC point c on sky [arcsec]
 Column 13 : Y position of AGC point c on sky [arcsec]
 Column 14 : X position of AGC point d on PFI [mm]
 Column 15 : Y position of AGC point d on PFI [mm]
 Column 16 : X position of AGC point d on sky [arcsec]
 Column 17 : Y position of AGC point d on sky [arcsec]

Note: point a, b, c, and d represent each corner of square AGC FoV. (See page 7 of "Notes_FiberIdentifications_v1.pdf" and "plot_pfs_fov.pdf")

Example
-------
 "plot_pfs_fov.pdf" contains plots that show the PFS FoV configuration just for your reference, which is essentially the same as those in "Notes_FiberIdentifications_v1.pdf". The first plot is the whole PFS FoV where cobra patrol area, area covered by dots, and the AGC FoV are shown by blue circles, orange circles, and red squares, respectively. The second plot is the zoom-in around X=0.6 deg. and Y=0.0 deg. (the edge of the FoV) including AGC positions. The third and forth one are much closer zoom-in images around X=0.0 deg. and Y=0.0 (the center of the FoV) and X=0.3 deg. and Y=0.0 deg. (the middle of the FoV), respectively. The fifth plot is the same as the forth plot, but it includes the possible dots coverage if the rotation of the FoV by a multiple of 60 deg. is considered (see above).
